PHP is loosely typed. Variables are not bound to specific types, but type control is often necessary for correctness.

### **Exercises**

##### 1. Write a function `add(int $a, int $b): int` with strict typing. Call it with both integers and strings and observe the result.

##### 2. Use `gettype()` and `var_dump()` to inspect a variable assigned different values.

##### 3. Cast a float to an integer and explain the result.

##### 4. Write a script that checks if a variable is `int`, `float`, or `string` using `is_*()` functions.

##### 5. Create a nullable string parameter function that returns a greeting.

##### 6. Write a function that accepts only arrays. Pass a non-array and handle the error.

##### 7. Demonstrate type juggling by adding a string `"100"` to a number and echo the result.

##### 8. Enable strict typing in a file and pass wrong types to a function.

##### 9. Show the behavior of `var_dump()` on an object, array, and boolean.

##### 10. Evaluate and explain the output of:
